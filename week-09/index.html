    <h2>ANIMATED LOGO</h2>
    <p> In the homepage, I would like to animate the logo to create a more approachable and inviting feel to my website. </p>
    <h2>SLIDESHOWS</h2>
    <p>Inside the pages with content on my projects, I would like to create slideshows the user can flip through instead of having all the pictures displayed at once. See this page of <a class= "links" href="https://rosielee.co.uk/work/londons-fastest-night/"> Rosie Lee's portfolio </a> and scroll down to "Work" for referece.  </p>

    <h2>TYPING TEXT </h2>
    <p> For the project "Herb - Open Typeface," I would like for the user to be able to type text in a box and have their text be visible in my Herb font, like in pages such as <a class= "links" href="https://www.1001freefonts.com/index.php"> 1001 Free Fonts </a>
    </p>

    <h2>CONTACT FORM</h2>
    <p> In the "Contact" page, I would like to add a Contact Form where users can write their comments and submit them. Althoug I would not follow her aesthetic, see <a class= "links" href="http://www.jessewillmon.com/#contact"> Jesse Willmon's contact page. </a> 
    </p>

    <h2>THUMBNAIL OVERLAY</h2>
    <p> I am not sure if it's possible, but in the Work gallery I would like the thumbnails to be clickable and go grayscale when the user hovers over them.
