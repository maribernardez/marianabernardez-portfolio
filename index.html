	<h1>Design of my website</h1>
	<h3 id="purpose"> Purpose of my website</h3>
		<p>
		To showcase my work as a Graphic Designer. </p>
    <h3 id="audience"> Intended Audience</h3>
		<p>
		Mainly potential employers in fields related to information design, editorial and publishing, or branding. </p>
    <h3 id="tone"> Tone of Written Content</h3>
		<p>
		A concise, approchable tone that however is well-versed and conceptual.  </p>      
    <h3 id="primary"> Primary Content</h3>
		<p>
		The primary content will have a navigation menu which will include the categories "Home," "Work," About," and "Contact." This menu will be present in all the pages of the website. Also in the landing page there will be a visual element (probably typographic, perhaps a description of myself as a designer). </p>
    <h3 id="secondary"> Secondary Content</h3>
		<p>
		The options of the menu have different secondary information. The most extensive of the categories will be "Work", which include both visuals and text of my work. The "About" page will have a brief description of myself and a link to my Resume, and the "Contact" information would include my e-mail address and social media. 
        </p>
    <h3 id="navigation"> Navitagion</h3>
        <p>
        The navigation is quite simple: a main menu that is present in all the pages of the website includes the categories "Home," "Work," "About" and "Contact." "Home" simply brings the user back to the beginning from anywhere in the page;  "About" and "Contact" have just one more level of navigation, and "Work" would first include clickable thumbnails of my work and, when clicked, more extensive information on them (both written -descriptions- and visual)
